**INGREDIENTS**

* 2 pounds beef short ribs
* 2 Tablespoons canola oil
* Salt and pepper
* 1/2 of an onion chopped
* 2 carrots chopped
* 3 ribs celery chopped
* 3 cloves garlic sliced thickly
* 3/4 bottle of Cabernet or any other dry red wine
* 4 sprigs fresh rosemary
* 3 cups chicken stock

**INSTRUCTIONS**
<br>Place the casserole dish in the oven and preheat to 300 degrees.
In a large skillet, heat the oil until just smoking. Season the ribs with salt and pepper and sear on top and bottom until brown and crispy. Transfer to a plate.
Add the onion, carrot, celery and garlic to the pan and cook until soft, about 15 minutes. Pour in the wine and rosemary, bring to a boil over a high heat. Take the casserole dish from the oven and place the ribs inside
Pour the wine mixture over the ribs and add the chicken stock. Place the lid on top and put it into the oven.
Cook for 1 1/2 hours and then turn each rib over. Cook for a further 30 minutes without the lid. Transfer the ribs to a plate and cover with foil. Strain the leftover liquid into a pan and reduce further until it thickens. Add a couple teaspoons of cornstarch/water mixture if you need it thickened faster.
